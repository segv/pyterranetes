Invocation
==========

To generate output from p10s scripts just run p10s and specify where
the scripts are locateed:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ p10s generate .

All p10s sub commands can be shortened to uniqeness, and the default
directory for ``generate`` is ``.``, so the above is equivalent to:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ p10s g
